    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Baked Dijon Salmon is a savory seafood dish that is typically prepared in the oven. The salmon fillets are coated with a mixture of Dijon mustard, honey, and melted butter, which gives them a rich and tangy flavor. 
        A topping made from bread crumbs, pecans, and parsley is then sprinkled over the fillets, adding a crunchy texture to the dish. Once assembled, the salmon is baked until it is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork. 
        The finished dish is typically served with a garnish of lemon wedges and is a flavorful and healthy choice for seafood lovers.</p>
