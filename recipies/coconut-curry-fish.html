    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Coconut curry fish is a flavorful dish that combines the sweetness of coconut milk with the savory taste of curry spices. Fresh fish is typically used for this dish, which is cooked in a creamy coconut sauce along with a variety of vegetables such as onions, peppers, and carrots. The curry flavor comes from a blend of spices such as turmeric, cumin, coriander, and ginger, which are simmered together with the coconut milk to create a rich and aromatic sauce. The dish can be served over a bed of rice, with naan bread, or alongside a variety of other side dishes such as steamed vegetables or lentils. Coconut curry fish is a popular dish in many cuisines, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Caribbean, and is loved for its bold and exotic flavors.</p>
