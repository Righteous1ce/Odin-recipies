        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Tuna fish salad is a popular cold salad that is made using canned tuna as the main ingredient. The tuna is typically mixed with mayonnaise, chopped celery, onion, and pickles, along with a variety of seasonings such as salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Some variations of the salad may also include chopped hard-boiled eggs, mustard, or lemon juice for added flavor. The mixture is then chilled in the refrigerator for a period of time to allow the flavors to meld together. Tuna fish salad is commonly served on a bed of lettuce, as a sandwich filling, or as a topping for crackers. It is a quick and easy meal that is perfect for lunch, dinner, or as a snack.</p>
